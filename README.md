# Deutsche Bank Coding Challenge

This step marks the simples possible solution, in terms of "hack it together dirty but quick". Minimal encapsulation, no really separation of concerns etc.

This kind of solution should **_never_** find its way into production. But it's useful for:

- prototyping some idea
- drilling down on requirement with the stakeholder/customer
- communicate ideas to the team
